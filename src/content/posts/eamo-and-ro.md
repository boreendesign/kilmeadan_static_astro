Seasonal Café & Larder on Main Street Kilmacthomas. Offering coffee and snacks during the day. Two or three nights a week, they offer a 3-course meal, but you need to reserve in advance. You can find them on Facebook or Instagram if you want to make a booking. If you can’t get in for a booking, they also offer takeaway as an option.

This family and dog-friendly area has a picnic site, forest, and walks by the lake shore. The area even has evidence of the ice age strewn with boulders. It’s also a short distance from the Comeragh mountains. The hills are full of beautiful flora with heather and bracken strewn across the slopes.

The area is reputed to have been a hiding place for ‘Crotty the Robber,’ a highwayman of the 19th century.

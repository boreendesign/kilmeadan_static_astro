Dating back to 1837, The Sweep Bar & Restaurant in Kilmeaden, Co. Waterford, has been a cornerstone landmark welcoming weary travelers with a warm Irish embrace ("ceol agus craic" - music and fun) for generations. Its distinctive thatched roof makes it instantly recognizable and a beloved part of the local landscape.

The Sweep, a family-run establishment for over 20 years under the ownership of Seamus and Michelle Dunphy, holds a special place in the heart of the Kilmeaden and Waterford communities. Beyond serving delicious food and drinks, they actively contribute by supporting local causes like Down Syndrome Ireland Waterford Branch through annual fundraising events and local sports teams like Ballyduff GAA.

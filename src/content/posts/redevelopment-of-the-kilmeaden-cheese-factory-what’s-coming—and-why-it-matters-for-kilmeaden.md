## **Why This Redevelopment Is Crucial for Kilmeaden**

1. **Economic Revival**

   The factory once anchored Kilmeaden’s economy, producing cheese from the 1960s until 2006. Its revival as a mixed-use hub—with housing, commercial services, and a tech park—could reinvigorate local job creation and economic activity.
2. **Community Infrastructure & Services**

   The addition of a health centre, café, community centre, pharmacy, and supermarket will transform Kilmeaden into a self-sufficient, attractive place to live—serving both new and existing residents.
3. **Sustainable Growth & Green Energy**

   The inclusion of a 40 MW solar farm and green infrastructure reflects a forward-looking, environmentally conscious approach to development. This could position Kilmeaden as a regional leader in sustainable rural regeneration.
4. **Modern Connectivity & Mobility**

   New roads, pedestrian and cycle links, and a site bridge will better connect Kilmeaden to its surroundings—enhancing mobility for residents and visitors alike.
5. **Balancing Development with Environment**

   With an EIAR and NIS included, the development is being designed to respect ecological and planning standards—critical in an area known for natural beauty and heritage.
